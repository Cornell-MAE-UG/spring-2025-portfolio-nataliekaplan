#### Projects
- **Screw Conveyor**:  
  *Prototype for the intake system of the Cornell Nexus Project Team robot. Picks up sand and transports it to the filter.*  
  - Came up with the idea to model the system after an Archimedes screw 
  - Designed a modular screw conveyor in SolidWorks
  - Tested effectiveness at different angles and heights

- **Keychain Umbrella**:  
  *Prototype of the Keychain Umbrella: a smaller, lighter, more durable version of an umbrella with a keychain so it can be hung on your bag.*  
  - Worked on a team of 6 to build a project to solve a problem
  - Interviewed people with different lifestyles to gather information about what problem to solve
  - Brainstormed ideas to help people travel in bad weather, coming up with 15 ideas and sketching each one
  - Ranked the ideas based on plausibility, cost, and effectiveness to decide on the Keychain Umbrella
  - Built a scrappy prototype out of cardboard and plastic bags to gauge what materials, manufacturing processes, and assembly methods we should use
  - Ordered appropriate materials and assembled an initial prototype using a hand saw, drill, and other tools
  - Evaluated the prototype based on previously defined metrics and designed and built an improved prototype

- **Foosbot CAD Recreation**:  
  *Recreated a Foosbot (a children's toy) using Fusion 360*  
  - Measured principal dimensions and sketched the Foosbot with dimensions
  - Disassembled the Foosbot and modeled each piece
  - Made an assembly with the pieces and rendered it with correct materials

- **Battery Supports**:  
  *Secured the battery on the Cornell Nexus Project Team robot.*  
  - Under a tight deadline and with limited materials, came up with an effective design to secure the battery 
  - Used L brackets and bent sheet metal to prevent the battery from moving or tipping
