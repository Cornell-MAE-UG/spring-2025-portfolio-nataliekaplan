**Overview**

For MAE 2250: Introduction to Mechanical Design, we were asked to form a team and design a prototype of a product to solve a problem. My team consisted of Rebecca Gerola, Ella Johnson, Carmen Lin, Maggie Huggins, and Maddy Nason. We interviewed many people about troubles they face in their everyday lives. The interviews showed that many people believe that carrying around umbrellas is annoying and umbrellas are easy to forget or lose. To fix this problem, my group came up with the idea of the Keychain Umbrella: a smaller, lighter, more durable version of an umbrella with a keychain so it can be hung on your bag. 

With the Keychain Umbrella, you won't forget to bring it because it will always be attached to your bag and it will be easily accessible since it won't be buried under all your other things. You won't have to awkwardly hold your wet umbrella after use, because you can just hook it onto the outside of your bag. There will be many colors and designs to choose from, so there will be one for everyone. 

**Initial Design and Scrappy Prototype**

An initial sketch of the Keychain Umbrella is shown below.

The sketch features interlocking pieces for the handle and the ribs. Waterproof fabric would be attached to the collapsible ribs. The ribs and handle would both be smaller than a regular umbrella. 

The next step to developing the Keychain Umbrella was building a scrappy prototype. We used materials such as cardboard, plastic bags, and dowels to build an initial prototype and figure out what kinds of problems we would face if we continued with the project. Rebecca and I worked together to create this prototype. An image of the completed scrappy prototype is shown below.

This prototype features 4 umbrella ribs made of dowels. The canopy is made of plastic bags that were duct taped together and cut into a circle. It is attached to the rod with a wire. 

Photos of the collapsible rod are shown below.

The rod is made up of incrementally larger cardboard cylinders that collapse into each other. This design was inspired by toy lightsabers. The rod has a paperclip attached to the end to act as a keychain. 

This scrappy prototype made us realize that the umbrella ribs would be the most difficult part of the project. The ribs made of dowels did not collapse, so we had to figure out a way to make them open and close. 

**Core Metrics, Functions and the Initial Prototype**

Before starting the initial prototype, we created a list of key metrics and functions that our product should accomplish. The metrics and functions are listed below. 

Core Metrics:
- Keychain sized (less that 6‚Äù long when collapsed)
- Waterproof
- Weigh less than 1.5lbs
- Strength is comparable to a regular umbrella

Core Functions:
- Shield user from rain
- Be portable
- Easy to collapse and put together
- Be sturdy enough to resist light wind

For the initial prototype, we focused more on functionality than materials. We wanted to make sure the mechanisms worked and that we can size them to fit within our parameters. The bill of materials for this prototype can be downloaded [here]({{ "/assets/umbrella-proto1-bom.pdf" | relative_url }}).

We used aluminum bars to build the ribs of the umbrella. We cut them using a hand saw and drilled holes into each end to screw them together. This allowed the umbrella to close and open. The ribs were then attached to each other using a custom connector that we designed and 3D printed. The umbrella ribs and the CAD for the connector can be seen in the pictures below.

The canopy was made of waterproof tarp. We cut the tarp to size and taped it onto the umbrella ribs. Due to circumstances out of our control, the handle we ordered did not come in time, so we built another handle out of cardboard. Pictures of the finished initial prototype are shown below.

We were able to cut the aluminum bars to a good size and pin them so they are free to move, allowing the umbrella to open and close. However, we were unable to implement our idea for the locking mechanism because there was no way for us to attach springs to the aluminum bars in a way that would lock the umbrella open. The aluminum bars were too thick compared to the springs. For the next prototype, instead of ordering aluminum bars and cutting them ourselves, we decided to CAD the bars in the size and shape we want and laser cut them. This way, they would all be uniform and fit together better. We also decided to order a lighter canopy for the umbrella, as the one we got was too heavy. We moved away from springs for the locking mechanism because they would introduce many more custom parts, which would greatly increase the cost of the product. 

**Second Prototype**

To improve upon the initial prototype, we evaluated the prototype against the metrics and functions defined above and used those results to design the improved keychain umbrella.
