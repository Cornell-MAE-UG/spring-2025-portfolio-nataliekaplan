For MAE 2250: Introduction to Mechanical Design, we were asked to form a team and design a prototype of a product to solve a problem. My team consisted of Rebecca Gerola, Ella Johnson, Carmen Lin, Maggie Huggins, and Maddy Nason. We interviewed many people about troubles they face in their everyday lives. The interviews showed that many people believe that carrying around umbrellas is annoying and umbrellas are easy to forget or lose. To fix this problem, my group came up with the idea of the Keychain Umbrella: a smaller, lighter, more durable version of an umbrella with a keychain so it can be hung on your bag. 

With the Keychain Umbrella, you won't forget to bring it because it will always be attached to your bag and it will be easily accessible since it won't be buried under all your other things. You won't have to awkwardly hold your wet umbrella after use, because you can just hook it onto the outside of your bag. There will be many colors and designs to choose from, so there will be one for everyone. 

An initial sketch of the Keychain Umbrella is shown below.

The sketch features interlocking pieces for the handle and the ribs. Waterproof fabric would be attached to the collapsible ribs. The ribs and handle would both be smaller than a regular umbrella. 

The next step to developing the Keychain Umbrella was building a scrappy prototype. We used materials such as cardboard, plastic bags, and dowels to build an initial prototype and figure out what kinds of problems we would face if we continued with the project. Rebecca and I worked together to create this prototype. An image of the completed scrappy prototype is shown below.

This prototype features 4 umbrella ribs made of dowels. The canopy is made of plastic bags that were duct taped together and cut into a circle. It is attached to the rod with a wire. 

Photos of the collapsible rod are shown below.

The rod is made up of incrementally larger cardboard cylinders that collapse into each other. This design was inspired by toy lightsabers. The rod has a paperclip attached to the end to act as a keychain. 

This scrappy prototype made us realize that the umbrella ribs would be the most difficult part of the project. The ribs made of dowels did not collapse, so we had to figure out a way to make them open and close.
