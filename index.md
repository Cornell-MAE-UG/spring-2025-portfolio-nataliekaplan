## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a rising junior mechanical engineering major at Cornell University. I am passionate about robotics and I want to use robots to improve lives and bring people joy. 

At Cornell, I am the Mechanical Lead of the Cornell Nexus Project Team, which is building a robot to filter microplastics from beach sand. I love my project team because it allows me to apply the engineering skills I learn in class to saving the environment, which is a cause I am passionate about. Coming up with creative solutions to do things no one has done before is exciting and I'm so grateful for this opportunity.
